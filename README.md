##Introduction
Welcome to the FTC Android Library! **The goal of this library is to provide a clean, well documented and easy to use library to help all FTC teams.** We encourage you to look around, try out the library, and **submit any issues you find**. For those new to using libraries in Android, we've included a friendly guide below.

We *strongly encourage* FTC teams to submit pull requests to this library. You will be helping other teams too! (For details on the pull request process and *important guidelines*, see the Contributing section at the bottom of this page.

##Getting Started
###Download Android Studio
Android Studio is the IDE used for developing Android apps. It is available for Windows, OSX and most Linux distributions and can be downloaded from [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

###Get the project
The most recent stable version of FTCLibrary can be found on [this page](https://github.com/lasarobotics/FTCLibrary/releases). Simply download the attached archive and extract it anywhere on your computer. Alternatively, you can clone the repository in git or browse to a specific branch to view development versions.

###Open the Project
From the Android Studio menu, select `Open an existing Android Studio Project` and browse to the location of the library. Android Studio will begin running setup and generate the necessary files to use the library. Once done, you should see a `samples` modules such as the one shown here.
